# Rooted Authenticity Audit

Assess how connected someone is to their authentic roots and provide guidance for reclaiming heritage, identity, and specific truth. The universal lives in the particular—the more specifically yourself, the more you connect.

---

## When to Use

- User feels disconnected from their authentic self
- Creative work feels generic or borrowed rather than owned
- Personal brand or voice lacks distinctiveness
- Someone is suppressing identity to fit in or appear professional
- Request for "finding authentic voice" or "I feel like I'm performing, not being"
- Cultural or heritage disconnect causing creative/personal blocks

---

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| context | Yes | Area of life or work where authenticity feels lacking |
| background | No | Heritage, culture, formative experiences, what shaped them |
| current_expression | No | How they're currently presenting/creating/communicating |
| disconnection | No | What specifically feels inauthentic or borrowed |

## The Audit Process

### Phase 1: Root Inventory

Identify the raw materials of authentic self—heritage, formative experiences, specific knowledge, what only you can know from where you come from.

**Frida's insight:** She dressed in Tehuana clothing, collected pre-Columbian artifacts, changed her birth year to align with the Mexican Revolution. Her roots were not backdrop—they were subject.

**Inventory questions:**
- Where are you from? (Not just geography—class, culture, family, neighborhood)
- What did you learn early that others learned late or never?
- What language, traditions, values were you raised with?
- What specific knowledge do you carry because of your particular path?
- What would you know that a generic version of your profession would not?

### Phase 2: Disconnection Diagnosis

Identify where authentic roots have been severed, suppressed, or borrowed over by external expectations.

**Frida's insight:** The Surrealists wanted to claim her. European collectors wanted to categorize her. She refused: "I never painted dreams. I painted my own reality."

**Diagnostic questions:**
- What parts of yourself do you hide professionally?
- What would feel too personal, too specific, too "unprofessional" to include?
- Whose voice are you imitating when you could be speaking your own?
- What aesthetic or approach have you adopted because it was expected, not because it was yours?
- Where did you learn that your specific truth was inappropriate?

### Phase 3: Authentic Elements Identification

Separate what is borrowed from what is owned. Map the authentic elements that could be reclaimed and integrated.

**Frida's insight:** She didn't become less professional by wearing traditional Mexican dress—she became more herself. The specific was her power.

**Identification framework:**

| Category | Borrowed/Generic | Authentic/Rooted |
|----------|------------------|------------------|
| Language | Industry jargon, safe phrases | The way you actually talk, specific vocabulary |
| Aesthetics | "Clean/professional" defaults | Visual language from your actual heritage |
| Stories | Generic examples | Specific experiences only you had |
| Knowledge | Widely-shared frameworks | What you know from your particular path |
| Values | Stated/expected values | What you actually believe from lived experience |

### Phase 4: Reclamation Practice

Concrete actions to reintegrate authentic roots into expression and work.

**Frida's insight:** She painted self-portraits—the most intimate subject. She included specific Mexican symbols, not general "cultural elements." She wore what she wore every day, not just in galleries.

**Reclamation questions:**
- What one rooted element could you reintegrate immediately?
- How would your work change if you stopped hiding where you came from?
- What story from your actual life have you never told professionally?
- What word, phrase, or image from your background could become signature?
- Who are you when you stop performing the generic version?

## Output Format

```markdown
## Rooted Authenticity Audit

### Root Inventory
**Heritage and origin:** [Where they come from—culture, class, geography, family]
**Specific knowledge:** [What they know because of their particular path]
**Formative experiences:** [What shaped them that a generic background wouldn't]

### Disconnection Map
| Area | What's Been Suppressed | Why It Was Suppressed |
|------|------------------------|----------------------|
| [area 1] | [authentic element hidden] | [expectation that caused hiding] |

### Borrowed vs. Owned
| Element | Currently Using | Authentic Alternative |
|---------|-----------------|----------------------|
| [voice/style/approach] | [generic version] | [rooted version] |

### Reclamation Prescription
**Immediate action:** [One thing to reintegrate now]
**Deeper practice:** [Ongoing work to reconnect with roots]
**The declaration:** [Claiming statement of authentic identity]

### Authenticity Test
[How to know when expression is rooted vs. borrowed—personal criteria for ongoing self-audit]
```

## Constraints

- Do not romanticize or exoticize heritage—treat it as material, not costume
- Do not prescribe what their roots should be—uncover what actually exists
- Do not equate professional with generic—authenticity can be rigorous
- Do not force disclosure of heritage they don't want to claim
- Do acknowledge that some suppression may be protective and chosen

**Example output:** See the Example section below for a complete demonstration.

## Example

**Input:** "I'm a first-generation college graduate from a small farming town. Now I'm a management consultant and I feel like I'm always performing—using frameworks I learned in business school, talking like people who grew up with way more privilege. My work feels like everyone else's. I don't know how to bring myself into it."

**Output:**

## Rooted Authenticity Audit

### Root Inventory
**Heritage and origin:** First-generation college graduate, small farming town. Working class roots. Agricultural rhythms—seasons, harvests, weather as economic reality. The knowledge of people who work with their hands and live close to consequences.

**Specific knowledge:** You understand what it's like when theory meets dirt. You know how decisions actually get implemented by people who don't have backup plans. You've seen systems that work across generations without consultants designing them. You know how to read people who don't use corporate language.

**Formative experiences:** Navigating between worlds—the family you came from and the professional world you entered. Being the first through a door. Learning to translate between different kinds of intelligence.

### Disconnection Map
| Area | What's Been Suppressed | Why It Was Suppressed |
|------|------------------------|----------------------|
| Language | Direct, practical speech; agricultural metaphors; working-class clarity | Business school taught "professional" language; firm culture rewards sounding like other consultants |
| Knowledge source | What you learned from watching your family run a farm/work with hands | Credentialed knowledge valued over lived knowledge |
| Perspective | Ground-level understanding of implementation; worker's-eye view | Client-facing work values executive perspective |
| Story | Your actual path—first-gen, class transition, worlds you've bridged | "Professional" background assumed; specificity feels like oversharing |

### Borrowed vs. Owned
| Element | Currently Using | Authentic Alternative |
|---------|-----------------|----------------------|
| Frameworks | McKinsey/HBR models | "Here's what I've seen actually work in places without resources" |
| Authority source | "Research shows..." | "In my experience watching systems that sustained for generations..." |
| Problem metaphors | "Low-hanging fruit," "moving the needle" | "You can't harvest what you didn't plant"; "Weather doesn't care about your timeline" |
| Credibility marker | Degrees, firm name | "I'm the only person in this room who's worked with their hands" |

### Reclamation Prescription
**Immediate action:** In your next client engagement, tell one specific story from your actual background that illuminates the problem. Not as autobiography—as expertise. "On my family's farm, we had a saying..."

**Deeper practice:** Start keeping a list of frameworks you learned from your first eighteen years that business school didn't teach. How did your family make decisions? Allocate resources? Build trust? Adapt to uncertainty? These are your proprietary methodologies.

**The declaration:** "I am the consultant who learned systems from people who couldn't afford to get them wrong. My first teachers planted crops and fixed machines and made decisions where failure meant no one ate. I bring that ground-level intelligence to boardrooms. I translate between worlds because I've lived in both."

### Authenticity Test
Your expression is **rooted** when:
- You're saying something a generic consultant couldn't say
- Your specific path is visible in the advice
- You're using language you actually use, not language you learned to use
- You feel like less of a performer and more like a translator

Your expression is **borrowed** when:
- You could swap your background with anyone's and the advice wouldn't change
- You're citing authority rather than owning what you know
- You catch yourself code-switching into a voice that doesn't sound like family dinner
- The work feels like costume rather than skin

## Integration

This skill is part of the **Frida Kahlo** expert persona. Use it when someone's work or expression has become disconnected from their actual origins—when the generic has overtaken the specific and they've forgotten that their particular roots are not limitations but material.
